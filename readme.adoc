The project is an attempt to discover,model and implement the parcel distribution processes (by using parcel machines).

Its main purpose is to learn some aspects Domain Drive Design.

= Domain Description

A detailed domain description can be found in the video materials on https://explorers.bettersoftwaredesign.pl/[the main page of the project].

= Domain exploration method - Event Storming Intro

Domain analysis is the most important part of software development. It is a time of intense learning. Developers need to understand the language of future system users.

Selection of the most appropriate method of domain exploration has a major impact on the success of the project.

In recent years, the Event Storming technique has become extremely popular.

It was described by Alberto Brandolini in his book https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming[Introducing EventStorming].

It is based on the assumption that  in an effective creative process (focused on problem solving) there are three main phases:

* *Divergent Thinking*

* *Emergent Thinking*

* *Convergent Thinking*



Based on : https://www.charlesleon.uk/blog/3-thinking-modes-of-creative-thinking-divergent-emergent-and-convergent-thinking24112019[Divergent, Emergent, and Convergent Thinking - 3 Thinking Modes]

== Event Storming - Big Picture Phase

The main goal of Big Picture Event Storming is to discover and model the main processes taking place in the domain.
Problem should be divide into smaller business parts, that can be analyzed independently.
